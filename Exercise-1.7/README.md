# Exercise 1.7

## Learning Goals
- Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
- Build your final command-line Recipe application

## Journal
1.	What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?

- An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) converts the contents and structure of a database into classes and objects that can be interacted with directly so you no longer need to worry about SQL code and syntax.

2.	By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?

- I think it went relatively well and I learned a ton within a relatively small amount of time. Something I did well was answer a lot of the challenges my mentor set forth in his feedback. Oftentimes, he would suggest ways to improve the coding and leave it to me to figure out, which I felt I was able to do consistently. I'm not sure there's anything I would change or improve, at the moment. If anything, just continue to tweak and enhance the end-user experience with the app.

3.	Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.

- By using instruction from a coding bootcamp I completed, I successfully created a Recipe app using Python. The application allows users to utilize Command Line to create, update, and delete recipes from a database as well as view all recipes and search for recipes by one or more ingredients.
 
4.	You’ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far: 
    a.	What went well during this Achievement? 

    - I think my consistent learning went really well during this Achievement. I feel that I learned a ton of new information about a new coding language and its abilities for creating user applications.

    b.	What’s something you’re proud of?

    - As previously mentioned, I'm especially proud of my ability to take the challenges my mentor set forth in his feedback and implement it in my code after taking the initiative to solution it out myself.

    c.	What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement? 

    - I think the Achievement as a whole was particularly challenging. For the majority of the bootcamp, I was working with HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript, so to go to a whole new coding language and continue to learn was especially challenging.

    d.	Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?

    - Yes, this Achievement met my expectations. As I mentioned, it taught me a ton about Python and certainly gave me a great deal of confidence in my ability to use this coding language.

    e.	What’s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?

    - I think I just want to continue learning as much as I can as well as build my confidence as a coder with Python.
