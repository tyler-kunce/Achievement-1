# Exercise 1.3

## Learning Goals
- Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
- Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
- Write functions to organize Python code

## Journal
1. In this Exercise, you learned how to use if-elif-else statements to run different tasks based on conditions that you define. Now practice that skill by writing a script for a simple travel app using an if-elif-else statement for the following situation: 

- The script should ask the user where they want to travel. 
- The user’s input should be checked for 3 different travel destinations that you define. 
- If the user’s input is one of those 3 destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Enjoy your stay in ______!”
- If the user’s input is something other than the defined destinations, the following statement should be printed: “Oops, that destination is not currently available.”

`travel_dest = input('Where would you like to travel today? ')

if travel_dest == 'New York':
    print('Enjoy your stay in New York!')

elif travel_dest == 'Chicago':
    print('Enjoy your stay in Chicago!')

elif travel_dest == 'Los Angeles':
    print('Enjoy your stay in Los Angeles')

else
    print('Oops, that destination is not currently available.')`

2. Imagine you’re at a job interview for a Python developer role. The interviewer says “Explain logical operators in Python”. Draft how you would respond.

Logical operators in Python check if conditions are met as True or False. The 'and' and 'or' operators can be used to check against multiple conditions. The 'not' operator can be used to check a certain condition is not met.

3. What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?

Functions are a set of instructions or operations for Python to run. They offer a vast amount of advantages one being they are reusable and can be called any number of times in a script. They are created or defined use the 'def' keyword followed by the name of the function (preferably, in snake case) with parentheses at the end that contain arguments or parameters.

4. In the section for Exercise 1 in this Learning Journal, you were asked in question 3 to set some goals for yourself while you complete this course.  In preparation for your next mentor call, make some notes on how you’ve progressed towards your goals so far.

I believe I'm making good progress towards the goals I have set for myself. I am certainly learning a lot about Python, an unfamiliar programming language to me. Though it doesn't seem like it at the moment, I do believe I am working towards another application for my portfolio and that working towards that will provide me with significant experience.
