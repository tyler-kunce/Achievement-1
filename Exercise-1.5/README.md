# Exercise 1.4

## Learning Goals
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts to your Recipe app

## Journal
1.	In your own words, what is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?

- Object-oriented programming, or OOP, generates objects out of classes. This makes code more organized, clear, efficient, and reusable.

2.	What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.

- Everything in Python is an object, though most commonly we deal with them in the data in which they contain and methods used to interact with data. Classes are overarching templates describing an internal structure. An example is a Class of Animals with Objects being Humans, Dogs, and Cats.

3.	In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine. 

| Method               | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inheritance          | Attributes or properties from a parent class are shared or inherited by a subclass.          |
| Polymorphism         | An attribute shares the same name across different classes but performs different functions. |
| Operator Overloading | Functions defined in Python to perform actions of operators such as +, -, <, >, etc.         |
