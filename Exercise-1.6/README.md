# Exercise 1.6

## Learning Goals
- Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

- Databases are collections of data that involve structure and organization in storing data for management. Because of their organization and structure of data, it makes for easy retrieval and management (update, delete) of the data.

2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

| Data type | Definition                                                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VARCHAR   | Data type of variable-length character strings consisting of alphanumerics |
| INT       | Integers that can be positive, negative, or zero                           |
| DATE      | Date values in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'                                  |

3.	In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

- SQLite, as the name suggests, is similar to MySQL but scaled down in functionality. It becomes useful for situations in which you test, troubleshoot, or prototype functions. MySQL, on the otherhand, offers robust management of databases, concurrent users, permissions, etc. that can be scaled up based on user and/or programmer needs.

4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

- The syntax is the biggest difference between JavaScript and Python that I've seen. Python seems to be quite a bit more straightforward and literal in the functions while JavaScript can be a little more cumbersome requiring expertise and experience. 

5.	Now that youâ€™re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

- It's hard to say what the limitations are. I can imagine with databases being involved, there can be plenty of issues with memory and performance. Memory given the amount of data that is being managed. Performance based on functions being performed, coding inefficiencies, etc.
